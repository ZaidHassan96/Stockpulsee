### Set up the PostgreSQL Database

Youâ€™ll need to configure your PostgreSQL database connection. This project uses SQLAlchemy to connect to the database.

1. Create the `secrets.toml` file in the root directory of the project.

2. Add the following configuration to `secrets.toml` to configure your database connection:

   ```toml
   [connections.development]
   type = "sql"
   dialect = "postgresql"
   host = "localhost"
   port = "5432"
   database = "companies"
   username = "your_username"
   password = "your_password"


### Running the Application

To automate the entire process (downloading stock data and seeding the database), you can run the provided `automate.sh` script.

1. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x automate.sh
   ```

2. Run the script:
     ```bash
     ./automate.sh
     ```


### Running the Streamlit App
